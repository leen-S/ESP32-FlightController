## How to Use

### 1. **Setup and Prerequisites**
- Install the necessary tools:
  - Arduino IDE (or PlatformIO) for uploading the firmware.
  - KiCAD for viewing and editing PCB designs.
- Ensure you have an ESP32 Dev Kit and other necessary components as specified in the schematics.

### 2. **Firmware Installation**
- Navigate to the `ESP32-Flight-Controller--main` folder.
- Open the provided `.ino` or equivalent firmware file in your IDE.
- Configure the project-specific parameters (e.g., pin mappings and calibration values).
- Upload the firmware to the ESP32 using a USB connection.

### 3. **PCB Manufacturing**
- Navigate to the `PCB Designs/KiCAD` folder.
- Use the Gerber files to manufacture the PCB:
  - Upload them to a PCB manufacturer (e.g., JLCPCB, PCBWay).
- Assemble the components as per the provided schematics.
